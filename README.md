# Nike Landing Page UI Clone 🏀

A modern, fully responsive Nike landing page UI built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
This project was developed as part of my journey to master Tailwind CSS and component-based frontend development.

> 📌 This is a **frontend-only static project** — all buttons and navigation are non-functional, focused purely on UI design and layout.

## 🎯 About This Project

I built this landing page by following a guided YouTube tutorial to sharpen my frontend skills.  
The objective was to:

- Understand and apply **Tailwind CSS** in real-world layout scenarios
- Learn how to create and reuse **React components**
- Practice clean UI design with responsive layouts
- Build a pixel-perfect clone of a modern e-commerce landing page

This project helped me gain confidence in using Tailwind's utility-first approach while structuring real-world UIs.
